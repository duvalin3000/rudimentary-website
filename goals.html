    <h2>Why​ do I want to learn this skill?
        What does it mean to you? What are your motivations? Will you prove something to yourself or
        people around you? Will you get a raise because you’re better at your job or will you get a better job?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I want to learn to code in order to support my siblings and give them a better life, the one we always
            dreamed of, no matter what.</li>
        <li>I'd like to make a lot of money I guess. I never had that luxury. It's something I and my siblings deserve,
            no matter what.</li>
        <li>I suppose I'd like to prove to myself and to others that I am someone who's always been capable.</li>
        <li>I just want disposable income lol. And to wake up one morning and see nothing but clouds and beauty.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>How will I ​feel​ if I never accomplish this?
        Would you feel disappointed? Would you feel like you’ve missed out?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I would hate myself I think. I mean truly just despise myself. Not necessarily if I don't get a beautiful
            home or whatever, moreso if I just never learn to code in general. I'd feel like a failure. That's why I'm
            not giving up.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>What would ​my life​ look like if I manage to accomplish this?
        Visualise it. What would life look like from the moment you wake up to the time you go to sleep? </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ideally, a beautiful home in Milford. I work remotely, hopefully. If not, oh well. I take Ingrid and Edgar
            to the river stream, to appreciate nature. We have a picnic on the weekends and watch movies in the backyard
            or something.<br>We take summer holidays to Japan, Italy, Greece, wherever else. Life is good.</li>
    </ul>
